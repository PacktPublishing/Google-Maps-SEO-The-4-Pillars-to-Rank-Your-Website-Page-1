## About the Video Course
Discover what you need to do to rank page 1 in Google Maps. Google Maps is the next revolution in Google. It's taken a backseat to YouTube for years, but 2018 is The Year of The Maps! With new changes and the ability to drive insane amounts of traffic to your website consistently, it's become one of my favourite tools for local businesses. What's that? You say you have a mobile business, are a real estate agent, or own a home business? That's OK, you can still list your business on Google Maps, increase your business today, and get a free local website provided by Google. I don't just leave you there, I also added 10 directories you can use to list your business without an address. This is a way to start your business on a zero budget. 70% of mobile users rely on Google maps to find a service/business that can serve their needs, driving calls and text SMS to your home-based business.
